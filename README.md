# Object_detection_OpenCV

This repository contains a method to detect **objects (refered from labels.txt) in images** as a representation of object presence in an image. I have utilized **OpenCV and python libraries** to detect the objects inside an input image. The method has the advantages of high accuracy and real-time performance. The presented system receives a series of images inside the folder and produces the processed image with added bounding-boxes containing the objects'.
